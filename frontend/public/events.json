        "about": "Two years ago, two major Python conferences teamed up: PyCon DE and PyData. This year, the cooperation will continue.Last year the event was cancelled.There’s still not that much information about the program of this year’s edition, but it’s planned as an in-person event.In 2019, the conference offered over 100 sessions dedicated to PyData topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and ethics, as well as Python topics like programming, DevOps, or Django. I’m sure we can expect a program just as rich this year."
