      "Description": "The React team recently announced the plan for React 18, bringing a lot of cool new features like automatic batching, new suspense SSR Architecture, and new APIs that leverage concurrent rendering like the startTransition API.For the past few years, the React team has been working on major features that will support concurrent rendering, those features are going to have a remarkable effect on both the user experience and the development process.There are a lot of resources where you can learn more about concurrent React, so I will not cover how it works behind the scenes in depth. Instead, I will show you three practical use-cases where I leveraged the new React startTransitionAPI to resolve major performance issues. A few words about the React startTransition API The new React startTransition API will help make your application more responsive, even during large screen updates. With this new API, you can substantially improve user interactions by marking specific updates as transitions. React will let you provide visual feedback during a state transition and keep the browser responsive while the transition is in progress. Think about yourself as a user: is not it frustrating that you type something and don not see those letters being painted until after a half-second? It immediately makes you think, Argh, this app is so slow! It is very important to render those UX-sensitive actions as fast as we can, and give quick feedback to the user. For all of the examples I have just shown you, there are surely other ways to mitigate them, like virtualization, lazy loading, or even simple solutions like throttling. Still, the React team has supplied us with a built-in mechanism for concurrent renders, a mechanism that no other frontend library has built yet.Built by the magicians at Facebook, the powerful React concurrent features enrich us with powerful tools that help us shape UX optimal applications and services optimize performance."

      "Description": "The degree of difficulty in learning JavaScript depends on the level of knowledge you bring to it. Because the most common way to run JavaScript is as part of a web page, you must first understand HTML. In addition, a familiarity with CSS is also useful because CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the formatting engine behind the HTML.Each piece of content is wrapped inside HTML tags that identify what that content is. Typical HTML tags wrap paragraphs, headings, lists and graphics, for example. An HTML tag encloses the content within angle brackets, with the tag name appearing first followed by a series of attributes. The closing tag to match an opening tag is identified by placing a slash in front of the tag name. For example, here is a paragraph element: JavaScript, however, is not a markup language; rather, it is a programming language. That by itself is enough to make learning JavaScript a lot more difficult than HTML. While a markup language describes what something is, a programming language defines a series of actions to be performed. Each command written in JavaScript defines an individual action — which can be anything from copying a value from one place to another, performing calculations on However, there is a caveat: To be able to properly use a markup language, you need to learn the entire language. Knowing part of a markup language without knowing the rest means that you cannot mark up all of the page content correctly. But knowing a part of a programming language means that you can write programs that use the part of the language that you know to create programs. While JavaScript is more complex than HTML, you can start writing useful JavaScript far more quickly than you might take to learn how to correctly mark up web pages with HTML. It will, however, take you a lot longer to learn everything that can be done with JavaScript compared to HTML."

It is next to impossible to gain expert knowledge of all the programming languages in demand and obtain a junior developer job in such a short amount of time.Luckily, many companies will hire junior developers who are still gaining proficiency in certain in-demand languages. One of those languages is JavaScript. JavaScript is the most common language for making webpages interactive. To really grab the attention of visitors to your website, you will want it to have interactive features. But how long will it really take to learn the basics of JavaScript? Let is dive in and see. It is very different from HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS are simple markup languages that provide structure and presentation to your website, JS is a full scripting language that controls many of the dynamic interactions on a webpage. If you look at your favorite webpage, you may notice responsive buttons, pop-ups, and alert boxes. Those were probably coded using JavaScript. To answer this question it is important to know that it is hard to set a definitive point when you have a mastery of a programming language. If you are reading this article it is safe to say you know English, but can you say you can define every word in the English dictionary? Unless you happen to work for Webster it is unlikely, much like how many JavaScript developers may not know every aspect of the language but can still use it effectively. "

JavaScript is one of the leading programming languages. In fact, it is called the programming language of the web. JS is a part of the ever-increasing number of programming options, many of which are, in actual fact, inspired from it. The advent of Node.js enabled JS to extend its reaches to the server-side. It became much easier for organizations to come in contact with full-stack developers that can work on both the frontend and backend using JavaScript. Hence, there is no need for cross-checking the fact that JS is among the best programming languages to start learning in 2019. JavaScript is the main powerhouse behind the rapidly evolving Internet. It is the present and will be the future. The rampant development of the high-level programming language asserts to the fact of JavaScript is the future. Still not convinced?

Front-end development of a web page becomes crucial in this context and it has been modernized the web development process in more efficient nowadays. You might observe some websites and wonder, “How did these frontend developers make the website so interactive?” The simple answer is JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular language of the web-end development. JavaScript is currently being used by more than 95% of the websites as the client-side scripting language. However, that does not mean the language is without any downsides. Its constant mix of libraries and frameworks demands a significant amount of time to master. It requires more code and it has a greater chance of getting repetitive, tangled and buggy. This initiated a search for alternatives to JavaScript. While most companies prefer JavaScript for front-end development, some companies hire developers who can handle JavaScript alternatives  mainly to tackle the front-end development differently. Gone are the days when JavaScript was the only platform for front-end development. Several supersets are emerging under the umbrella of JavaScript. Amongst all these flavors of JavaScript, five of them established themselves as better JavaScript alternatives for front-end development. 1. Typescript 2. CoffeeScript 3. ClojureScript 4. Elm 5.

Many front-end and back-end JavaScript alternatives out there are pretty awesome, you just need to know which ones are right for your needs. We got you covered! Read on to learn more. As a web developer, you have probably been working with JavaScript throughout your career and maybe looking for the best JavaScript alternatives right now. JavaScript has been a prominent language for developers worldwide since its inception in 1995. As of early 2020, it was still the most used programming language with almost 68% of respondents in a survey choosing JS as their preferred language. But despite its nearly 3-decade-long journey, developers still have a love-hate relationship with this language. Some say it is not even a proper programming language, while others swear by it. So, why this difference of opinion? And what are the best JavaScript alternatives, if you need one? We will discuss all of this and more below. Although JavaScript has evolved over its 26 years of existence, there are some drawbacks that seem to have stuck and these are what cause developers a lot of difficulties to cope with. There are experienced JS developers who argue that all it needs is a better understanding of its logic and most of the limitations have been overcome by IDE. We agree that every programming language has its limitations and exceptions, and there is usually a way to get around these constraints. But today, there are a number of alternatives that you can use instead of JavaScript. "

But when people were using JavaScript then developers get to know that JavaScript can be used as a server-side programming language also. But When JavaScript was growing then the code of JavaScript became complex and heavy. Because of this, JavaScript was even not able to full fill the requirement of an Object-oriented programming language. This prevents JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise level as a server-side technology. Then TypeScript was developed by the development team to bridge this gap. TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code:: TypeScript code is not understandable by the browsers. That is why if the code is written in TypeScript then it is compiled and converted the code i.e. translate the code into JavaScript.The above process is known as Trans-piled. With the help of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display it. JavaScript is TypeScript: Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts. TypeScript code can be run on any browser, device, or in any operating system. TypeScript is not specific to any Virtual-machine etc. TypeScript supports JS libraries: With TypeScript, developers can use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and can be called from other JavaScript code."

About 60% of JS programmers already use TypeScript, and 22% wish to try. Why? Historically, JavaScript has ended up as the main language for scripting web pages and apps on the Internet. It is now possible to use JavaScript on both the frontend and the backend with frameworks like Node.js and Deno. But was JavaScript made for creating large, complex systems like the ones on the modern web? No. In this article, we will introduce you to a solution for that TypeScript and get you started towards the path of adding types to your JavaScript code. Types are a way to tell correct programs from incorrect before we run them by describing in our code how we plan to use our data. They can vary from simple types like Number and String to complex structures perfectly modeled for our problem domain. Programming languages fall into two categories: statically typed or dynamically typed. In languages with static typing, the type of the variable must be known at compile-time. If we declare a variable, it should be known (or inferrable) by the compiler if it will be a number, a string, or a boolean. Think Java. In languages with dynamic typing, this is not necessarily so. The type of a variable is known only when running the program. Think Python. Explicit types also make your code self-documenting: they make sure that your variables and functions match what is intended and enable the computer to take care of remembering the surrounding context."

Additionally, it is used by more than 95% of websites on the web. From a security perspective, JavaScript is fourth on the list of the most vulnerable languages only behind Java, PHP, and C. For this reason, developers must remain proactive and defensive in securing their JavaScript applications to keep the web safe. This post dives into common JavaScript vulnerabilities, the risks they pose, and how developers can address these vulnerabilities to keep their web applications secure. According to OWASP, cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most widespread security risks in web applications. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into the client-side of an application. This normally happens when an application accepts untrusted (or user-supplied) data on a web page without escaping or validating it properly. A successful XSS attack occurs when the browser executes the malicious scripts from in a manner determined by the threat actor. Generally, XSS attacks will require some form of interaction from the victim, either through social engineering or request to visit a particular page. If an attacker exploits XSS vulnerabilities, they could perform malicious actions like account tampering, data theft, remote control, or even malware distribution."

It is used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike. Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix is recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it is designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done. Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it is relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances. Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks. Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras. Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user does not see. Python is role in web development can include sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask."

One common question arises in mind of most people, especially beginners and newbies, that why Python is popular in mainstream despite being slow? or why programmers or developers do not care about speed and performance limitations in Python? In this post, I will go through some main reasons for this. Before diving into details of why Python is popular in mainstream despite being slow, I will shortly explain how or why Python is slow in nature in terms of performance and speed as compared to other popular programming languages like C and C++. High-level programming language: With Python, the code looks very close to how humans think. For this purpose, it must abstract the details of the computer from you: memory management, pointers,… Hence, it is slower than “lower-level language” like C; Python is interpreted and not compiled: Sure, this statement is a gross simplification but it is somehow correct. During the execution, Python code is interpreted at runtime instead of being compiled to native code at compile time; Can you really feel the difference between 0.001 seconds or 0.01 seconds? The answer is most likely no. Normally, it does not matter too much to the end-users if your program takes just a little bit longer for its execution. As long as we do not write a program which executes in centuries and totally destroys end-user experience, it is fine. In case it takes too long, horizontal scaling can be used to solve many bottlenecks that would have been created by Python and make the execution faster."

Though it is dense, with a multitude of libraries to learn and cipher through, Python is syntax is considerably simple, and its concepts are relatively straightforward. The easy syntax makes for quick learning and contributes to a generally intuitive and streamlined coding experience. That really eases the workload on your brain as you delve into bigger and more complex projects. Python is also a very versatile language. It is used in many different types of projects and by many large organizations, including Facebook, NASA, Reddit, and Amazon.

You can find some libraries here. Python has an easy implementation for OpenCV. What makes Python favorite for everyone is its powerful and easy implementation. For other languages, students and researchers need to get to know the language before getting into ML or AI with that language. This is not the case with Python. Even a programmer with very basic knowledge can easily handle Python. Apart from that, the time someone spends on writing and debugging code in Python is way less when compared to C, C++ or Java. This is exactly what the students of AI and ML want. They don not want to spend time on debugging the code for syntax errors, they want to spend more time on their algorithms and heuristics related to AI and ML Not just the libraries but their tutorials, handling of interfaces are easily available online. People build their own libraries and upload them on GitHub or elsewhere to be used by others. Endless trade offs in all these areas: what python has in simplicity/built in libraries it can lose in stuff like speed, memory usage etc. Somewhat like vehicles - a simple automatic car is easy to learn to drive with and get around a city but will not get you very far in a race vs a race car, plane or an aircraft carrier.

It uses a set of instruments that engage the native control elements of each platform. In BeeWare, buttons, checkboxes, and other elements provided by the system for which the app is developed will play the role of UI controllers. That is why the product will look 100% native while being used on the platform you have built it for. So, you can create native mobile apps for Android or for iOS in Python with the help of the BeeWare framework. Python mobile development was not popular previously.

      "Description": "Python and Java are two of the most popular and robust programming languages. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language. As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code. Java is efficiency largely comes from its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and support for concurrency. The JIT compiler is a part of the Java Runtime Environment. It improves performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes into native machine code “just in time” to run. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls the compiled code directly. Since the code is not interpreted, compiling does not require processor time and memory usage. Theoretically, this can make a Java program as fast as a native application. While Java programs are compiled directly, Python is interpreted which slows down Python programs during runtime. Determining the variable type which occurs during runtime increases the workload of the interpreter. Also, remembering the object type of objects retrieved from container objects contributes to memory usage. In Python, any bugs introduced by the programmer will not be found until that line of code is triggered. This can risk operational breakdowns and extend turnaround time. While Python leaves objects vulnerable to mutation, in Java object mutations is impossible. This leads to secure software development."

Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing. The popularity of Java is further evidenced with 90% of all Fortune 500 companies using Java. The TIOBE Programming Community publishes an index showing the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated several times per year. The top ten programming languages, per the latest report, are shown below. The portability of Java contributes to its wide use and popularity, but there are other reasons why software developers continue to choose Java. Since it is an object-oriented language; it is robust, secure and relatively simpler and easier to learn than languages such as C and C++. Object-oriented languages make complex problems easier to solve and provide greater modularity. This is a natural and pragmatic approach for software design. Java objects encapsulate data and behavior so that code can be reused, which makes testing and troubleshooting easier. With Java, objects are created using classes that define the attributes (data) and behaviors (defined by methods coded in the class). Java features such as inheritance further contribute to simplified code. With inheritance, similar but different types of objects are simplified by inheriting common attributes and behaviors from the parent class. This allows reuse of the common code while allowing for differences."

There are thousands of unfilled Java jobs not only in the United States but all over the world. If you want to get a great job in software development, it will help if you can code in one of the four programming languages. Java is a mainstream programming language with great career prospects. It has been a leading programming language for more than 25 years. Java is an excellent programming language for web applications, server-side code, cloud applications, and IoT (Internet of Things). This language is also popular for creating Android apps. ava is a great career choice if you are interested in software development. The average Java developer salary is $105,800. The top Java developers can expect to earn more than $141,500. Even on the low end of the job market, you could make $85,000. How much Java you need to learn to get a job has everything to do with how much Java you know already. If you are already a software developer working with another programming language like Java, you should be able to come up to speed fast. This is important because of how much Java you need to learn depends on your current knowledge. If you are now working as a Python programmer, you can learn the basics of Java fast, such as syntax. But if Java is your introduction to the world of software development, you are looking at a very different journey. You will need a lot more time to learn the skills you need to land a Java developer job."

The count of Java developers is rapidly growing. Learning Java does not make it possible to happen overnight, and it takes time and practice. It is very difficult to give the correct answer to the question of how many days required to learn Java? Because each person has not the same strength or learning power. The scope of Java programming is immense and provides a lot of carrier opportunities in the IT field. Everyone wants to learn Java programming as soon as possible, but it is not easy. To become a successful Java developer, the only way is to do the practice of all basics and advanced concepts of it. If we follow the following learning path, we can learn Java in one month only. If we are beginners in Java programming or other programming languages, we need to clear all the basics fundamentals of that language. Before diving into the core concept of Java, we need to learn about the introduction of language, features, applications, etc. After that, we should know how we can set up the Java runtime environment. We should also have to learn how we can create, compile and run the \"Hello World\" java program. At this level, we also need to explore the IDEs that help us to do Java programming. So, in the end of the day, we have knowledge of the following concepts: After getting the knowledge of Java programming is prerequisites, we are ready to move on to some advanced concepts of it. In Java, String and Array are both important, and the developer should have detailed knowledge of them. At this step, we have to gain knowledge about:"

      "Description": "Java is the technology of choice for building applications using managed code that can execute on mobile devices. Android is an open source software platform and Linux-based operating system for mobile devices. The Android platform allows developers to write managed code using Java to manage and control the Android device. Android applications can be developed by using the Java programming language and the Android SDK. So, familiarity with the basics of the Java programming language is a prerequisite for programming on the Android platform. This article discusses where Java fits in mobile application development and how we can use Java and Android SDK to write applications that can work on Android devices. What made Java be the technology of choice for mobile development for the Android platform? The Java Programming Language emerged in the mid-1990s; it was created by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems. Incidentally, Sun Microsystems was since bought by Oracle. Java has been widely popular the world over, primarily because of a vast array of features it provides. Java is promise of “Write once and run anywhere” was one of the major factors for the success of Java over the past few decades. Java even made inroads into embedded processors technology as well; the Java Mobile Edition was built for creating applications that can run on mobile devices. All these, added to Java is meteoric rise, were the prime factors that attributed to the decision of adopting Java as the primary development language for building applications that run on Android. Java programs are secure because they run within a sandbox environment. Programs written in Java are compiled into intermediate code known as bytecode. This bytecode is then executed inside the context of the Java Virtual Machine. You can learn more about Java from this link."

      "Description": "PHP, a server-side language that has been around for more than 25 years, tends to evoke some strong opinions among developers today. Whenever a new programming language or tool emerges, you will probably find a discussion over where PHP is dead. It is true that PHP has slipped down the rankings of the most popular programming languages, from 5th in 2017 to 8th in 2020 as per the Stack Overflow annual developer survey. And yet, PHP continues to be used by nearly 80% of all websites, powering some major platforms like Wordpress and Facebook. So what gives? PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data. Its use has evolved over the years, with regular upgrades (version 8.0 was released in November 2020) adding features and unlocking new capabilities. It is easy to learn and use: One of the main reasons PHP became so commonplace is that it is relatively simple to get started with. Even without extensive knowledge or experience in web development, most people could create a web page with a single PHP file in a relatively short period of time. The syntax is simple and command functions are easy to learn, meaning the barriers to entry with PHP are lower than with many other languages. It is open source (and therefore free!): This also helps developers get started with PHP - it can be installed quickly and at zero cost. There is also open access to a wide range of PHP frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony. This feature is also appealing to companies as it helps control the costs of web development."

      "Description": "As a developer, you might have heard that “PHP is dead”, “PHP is very old no one uses it these days!” But is it really dead? Let is discuss the Pro is and Con is of the PHP, and then let is determine whether PHP is really dead. According to the blog on kinsta, 79% of the web uses PHP till date on production. Well, you may think why is this because WordPress is a significant contributor here. WordPress is built on PHP, so all the websites that use WordPress are internally built on PHP. As PHP is used so widely on the web, new improvements and updates are coming to PHP perpetually, like in the recent PHP 8 update, it got a JIT(just-in-time) compiler. PHP is getting faster. As you can see in the image, its ability to handle the number of requests per second has been increasing steadily. PHP has very high-quality frameworks, and one of those is Laravel. Laravel is a very good back-end framework for PHP and has built-in good practices and security for your web app. In fact the first version of Codedamn was also built using PHP itself. PHP also has a huge developer community that can help you overcome any technical difficulty you face. On websites like Stackoverflow, many developers respond and help you tackle your bugs in PHP. PHP is very popular in the freelancing community as it is one of the easiest languages to learn for non-technical people to manage their back-end part of a website. So many people still offer some best gigs to manage PHP websites. So now you also have a pretty good chance to freelance using PHP as well. Also, you have WordPress that helps you with wp-config files. PHP suffers from lousy performance when compared to languages like Golang and runtime like Node.JS because it is fundamentally architectured to run a different process for every request that it gets. So that is a good reason why we should use other languages than PHP."

Today we are going to take a look at the difference between Javascript and PHP as well as their similarity. PHP and Javascript are the most popular languages for web development, and people often wonder which one is better. Just like with all other technologies, there is no accurate answer. In this blog post, we will show why. PHP and Javascript have a lot in common but still, there are some significant differences that make each of them a better tool for a particular part of the development. Javascript is an object-oriented and interpreted scripting language released in 1995. The source code can be easily read by anyone which makes Javascript simple yet not so secure. It is probably the best tool for building creative and user-friendly web pages. As it is executed in the browser, at the client side, Javascript allows a quick response and less load on the server. Javascript used to be a front-end language but then Node.js appeared allowing software engineers to use Javascript for both back-end and front-end development. Javascript is a perfect choice for creating a dynamic SPA (single page application) and for working with front-end technologies like AngularJS and ReactJS as well as with server technologies like MongoDB, CouchDB, and NoSQL. Just like Javascript, PHP is an object-oriented and interpreted scripting language released in 1995. It was created for web development but now can be used as a general-purpose language. The main difference from Javascript is that PHP is a server-side language used for back-end and executed on the server. It has more features, richer libraries, and better security compared to JS."

While some fiercely defend one language, others find only flaws in it. Therefore, we are not going to give a certain answer about what is the best programming language to learn and use for web programming. But we will give all the resources and insights possible so that you can decide what suits you and your project the best. Due to its logic of “Write Once, Run Anywhere”, programmers can write a code once and it will work on every platform that is compatible with Java, including computers and smartphones. It is explained by the fact that Java is a high-level language with more complicated processes. Java compiler converts code into bytecode and afterward, Java Virtual Machine converts it for the device it runs on. PHP was significant in the creation of content management systems WordPress, Joomla, Drupa all use PHP. PHP is an interpreted language and the interpretation is done only once. It also means that PHP works only on the services that have PHP installed. Luckily, many systems do support the scripting language. Web development is flourishing today. More and more web sites and web applications are created daily. Only in 5 years, the number of websites grew from 968,9 million in 2014 to 1,72 billion in 2019. Since the pandemic started, many businesses moved online as well. More web applications are created to fulfill the duties that people had to do manually in the office but now they can not. "

But, when it comes to picking one of them, there is always confusion, and to resolve any doubt on which to choose for your next project? Here is a detailed comparison between the two backend technologies in terms of performance, architecture, community support, database support, and many more aspects. Frontend deals with the client-side activities, while backend takes charge of server-side interactions. Whenever a user fills a form or enters a web address, the browser sends a request to the server-side, sending a code to the client-side. Your browser will interpret the frontend code and display the information. Editor is note: Hiren briefly explains all the aspects such as performance, support, and development that you can consider while choosing between Django and PHP for a new project. If you are looking for an experienced team to start your project, consider turning to Simform is custom web application development offerings. Django and PHP are the two most preferred frameworks that stand out from their counterparts. By the end of this comparison performance, scalability, architecture support, and ease of development between Django and PHP, you will have maximized the understanding of these backend technologies. Django is a popular web framework written in Python. This free, open-source framework was first introduced by two web programmers, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, working at Lawrence Journal-World newspaper to develop applications. Named after the famous guitarist Django Reinhardt, its development began in 2003 while the first milestone release came out in September 2008."

It is an extension of C, which has been the main system programming language for quite some time. In contrast to C, it supports object-oriented programming features like classes. Like C, it is used when a low-level programming language is necessary. While C++ is commonly used for graphics-heavy software such as games, photo and video editing apps, browsers, C is more widely used for embedded devices and OS kernels. C with Classes In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist working at Bell Labs, started work on a new programming language called \"C with Classes\". A large inspiration for the language was Simula, which is considered to be the first object-oriented programming language ever. While Stroustrup was programming for his PhD thesis, he found Simula pleasant to program in, but the language was too slow for practical use. Therefore, he set out to add Simula-like features to C, in that way making a language that was both performant and relatively high-level for the time. In 1982, Stroustrup started to build the next version of his language. He built a new compiler based on the existing C compiler and added a ton of new features. After cycling through a couple of names, he ended up with \"C++\". The name comes from the C is incrementation operator—it means C plus one. Like any programming language, C++ is not the perfect tool for all of the jobs. Let is look at the advantages and disadvantages of writing your program in C++."

In the other corner you have the Java programming language—developed by Sun Microsystems with the mantra. Which language is right for your software project? You have probably done a little research into the right language, but it is difficult for someone without software development expertise to determine which one is right. Both Java and C++ have been in production for years. They both have similar syntax, support object-oriented programming (OOP), and they both power some of the biggest enterprise platforms on the market. Most C++ programmers will tell you that converting to a Java project is easy for them since style and syntax are very similar. Even with the similarities, however, the two languages are worlds apart. Java is an interpreted language, while C++ is a compiled language. This dissimilarity will play a huge role in your future project. In this article we are going to take a look at the top differences between Java and C++. What are the differences between Java and C++. A common misconception is that if a language is similar to another, then it must be similar in functionality. While Java and C++ are similar in syntax, they are far more dissimilar in the way they execute and process. Java is an interpreted language, which means it is “translated” to binary at the time of execution. This allows it to run on any operating system regardless of where it was written. C++ is a compiled language, which means your program is compiled on a specific operating system and runs only on that particular operating system. If you want it compatible with another operating system, you must compile your program on it."

C++ introduced the concept of Class and Objects. It encapsulates high and low-level language features. So, it is seen as an intermediate level language. Earlier it was called “C with classes” as it had all the properties of the C language. C-Sharp is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework. It has features like strong typing, imperative, declarative, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming. It was developed by Microsoft within the .NET platform. The name “C sharp” was inspired by musical notations. Here # symbol indicates that the written note must be made a semitone higher in pitch. C++ language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT & T Bell Laboratories. Stroustrup was a strong supporter of C an admirer of Simula67. He wanted to combine the best of both the languages. He was aiming to create a language which supports object-oriented programming features and still retains the power of C. This resulted in C++. Anders Hejlsberg is the key contributor to C# language development. In 1999, he built a team to develop a new language which was then called cool. The project was approved and announced in July 2000 at the .Net Developers Conference. The language was later renamed as C#.

      "Description": "The difficulty with finding a successor to C++ is twofold: it has massive adoption, and it is hard to massively improve on for the systems programming tasks that it excels at. There is a huge amount of code written in C, and a huge number of people familiar with the language. The means that any language hoping to supplant it cannot just be incrementally better than C, it has to be a big enough improvement to justify retraining people and rewriting code. In the case of COBOL, another language with a huge legacy, other languages were enough of an improvement to justify the effort to move away from it. C, however, is still actually pretty hard to improve on for systems programming, where you want a language that is close to the machine yet provides some abstraction capabilities. C provides most of the abstraction capabilities that you want in a systems language: functions, arrays, strings, pointers, structs, etc, in a way that is fairly minimal and orthogonal. If you started with a blank slate, you could combine those features in a way that was a bit more elegant than C, but not massively so. I think any successor to C would have to offer some major feature beyond what is currently in C, without giving up the simplicity, minimalism and control that C gives you. Most efforts at designing new languages since the 80 is have included some form of automatic memory management, which is great for most applications, but rules them out for a lot of systems programming. Rust is an interesting project because they are able to address some of the major problems of C, particularly memory management, in a way that does not give up as much of what makes C good."
